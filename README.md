This repository contains code used to create a user tech blog. The blog is built to allow a user to login to a dashboard screen and then they are able to create a new post on the blog
and then they are able to edit it or delete it. 

This allows for a fairly high functionality from the user when it comes to interacting with each post. Node.js is used to include a abundance of packages including MySQL2, Sequelize,
Express, Express-Handlebars, Bcrypt and Environemntal Variables in the form of a .env file.

There is still some server connection issues when trying to run the blog on Heroku and those are currently being dealt with. Once they are resolved then a live version will be 
deployed to Heroku and a URL will be posted here.
